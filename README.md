This project embarks on the design and fabrication of a 5V 2A Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit. At the core of this endeavor lies the aspiration to craft a power supply unit that excels in
efficiency, reliability, and versatility. The primary aim is to meticulously engineer a circuit that can provide a consistent 5V output while accommodating a maximum load of 2A. By harnessing the capabilities of
cutting-edge components and adhering to best practices in electronic design, this project seeks to realize a SMPS circuit that meets the stringent demands of modern electronics applications.
The SMPS is initially designed by using kiCad which is a free software suite for electronic design automation and after the final verification of gerber files we as a team implemented in Zero PCB board 
by collecting hardware components and final implementation can be seen in the repo files here.
